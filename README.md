# 🎢 Roller Coaster Track Geometry & Safety Analysis

This project demonstrates how **mathematical modeling and curvature analysis** can be used to
design **safe and comfortable roller coaster tracks**.  
A 3D visualization is used to highlight **safe and unsafe regions** of a toy roller coaster
based on curvature.

## 📌 Project Objective

To model a toy roller coaster track mathematically and analyze its **curvature** to judge
whether the design is **safe for passengers**.
